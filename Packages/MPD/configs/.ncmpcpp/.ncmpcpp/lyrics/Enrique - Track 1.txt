It's my time, It's my life, I can do what I like
For the price of a smile, I gotta ticket to ride
So I keep living, cause it feel's right

And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes and no, never stop
Give me more, more, more

Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

Should we love, makes us one
Let's make a beautiful world
Take my hand, it's alright
Cuz tonight, we can fly

So we keep living, cause the feel's right
And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes and no, never stop
Give me more, more, more
Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

What y'all consider the best, I consider mediocre!
I want my bank account like Carlos Slim's, or at least Mini Oprah
Baby just close your eyes, and imagine any part in the world, i've been there
I'm like global warming, you think I just started to heat the things up, but I've been here
Time traveller, two time zones, give me some of my vodka any zone,
Enrique Iglesias, and translation, Enrique Churches, confession
Dale mamita, di m elo todo, alante tu hombre, yo me hago el bobo
No te preocupes, baby for real
Because you gon like how it feels

Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

I like how it feels...
I like how it feels..
